        <p >This mock website will serve as a design document as well as a feedback/comment database for a 
            game I wish to develop. This game will be a turn based RPG focused on surviving the depths of the mountain of Kholdor
            (name of both the mountain and the game is subject to change). I intend to base the game off of Gameboy and DS pokemon games.
